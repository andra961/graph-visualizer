# Graph-Visualizer

A `react.js`(with `typescript`) app to visualize and interact with graph algorithms. In particular, in its current form, the app aims to solve the Leetcode problem [rotting-oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/), which requires a `Breadth First Search` to be solved optimally in `O(m * n)` time and `O(m * n)` space complexity.

# Try it yourself
